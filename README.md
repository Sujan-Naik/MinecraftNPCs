# Human-like NPCs
__This plugin makes it possible to spawn NPCs that behave almost indistinguishably from players__ 

The NPCs persist without players on.

This is a type of weak AI (namely Reactive Machine AI) because it does not have a memory and can only perform behaviour that is pre-determined.
However the Minecraft world is technically not stochastic so this doesn't serve as that much of an issue.
